# FrequencyDivider
Clock Frequency Divider from 100MHz to 3.5Hz using verilog on vivado software.

Waveform:-

It can be observe that :




timeperiod (T) = (572.040 - 285.040) * 10^-3 sec
           = 0.287 sec
           
           
           
So frequency of resultant waveform is,
Frequency = 1/T
          = 1/0.287
          = 3.48 Hz ~ 3.5Hz
          
          


RTL Design of it is as:
